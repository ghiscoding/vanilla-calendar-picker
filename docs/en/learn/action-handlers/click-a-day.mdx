# Handling Click on a Day

Various actions are available for user interaction with the calendar, one of which is `clickDay()`. This action allows you to track the moment when a user clicks on a specific day in the calendar.

Example with logging the selected day to the console:

<Sandbox example="action-handlers-click-a-day" />

Please note that the selected day is represented as an array because the user can select not only one day but also a range of dates if allowed by the calendar parameters.

<Sandbox example="action-handlers-click-a-day-ranged" />

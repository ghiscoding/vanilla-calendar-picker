# Automatic Localization

If your locale is supported by the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleString" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">`.toLocaleString()`</a> method, you can simply pass it to the `settings.lang` parameter for calendar localization.

If the locale is not supported or translated incorrectly, you can always set the locale manually, as explained in the next section.

# First Day of the Week

The calendar follows the **ISO 8601** standard to determine the first day of the week. If the `settings.iso8601` parameter is set to `true`, Monday will be the first day of the week. Otherwise, if `settings.iso8601` is set to `false`, Sunday will be the first day of the week. You can customize this parameter according to your preference.

# Time Selection Options

By default, time selection is disabled, but you can easily enable it and configure it to meet your needs.

## 12-Hour Time with AM/PM

You can enable the 12-hour time format and add AM/PM markers.

<Sandbox example="additional-features-enable-time-picker-12" height={400} />

## 24-Hour Time

If you need a 24-hour time format without AM/PM, you can configure it as follows.

<Sandbox example="additional-features-enable-time-picker-24" height={400} />

## Setting Your Own Time

You can set the initial time when initializing the calendar. For a 24-hour day, you don't need to specify an AM/PM marker.

<Sandbox example="additional-features-enable-time-picker-your-time" height={400} />

## Time Step Control

In addition, you can configure the time step for minutes and hours. You can also disable manual input of time in the input field.

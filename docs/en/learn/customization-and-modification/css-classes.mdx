# CSS Classes

All CSS classes used in the calendar are variables that can be customized by replacing them with your own values. However, it's important to note that when making such replacements, you'll also need to independently add styles for the modified CSS class.

Below is an example of replacing the class for arrows with your own. The complete list of classes can be found in the reference guide.

# Pop-ups

The calendar allows you to add pop-ups with information for any day, which will be displayed when hovering over that day.

This is a useful tool for displaying additional data in the calendar.

In the example given, specific days are highlighted using CSS modifiers, and information is added to pop-ups for each of them.

Further details about pop-ups can be found in the <a href="/docs/reference/additionally/pop-ups">reference</a>.
